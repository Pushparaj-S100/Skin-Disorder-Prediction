🌿 Skin Disorder Prediction
A machine learning project for the detection and classification of skin disorders using image or clinical data. This tool aims to support healthcare professionals in early diagnosis and better management of skin-related conditions.

🧠 Project Overview
Skin disorders affect millions worldwide and early diagnosis is critical for effective treatment. This project leverages computer vision and machine learning techniques to automatically classify skin conditions based on input data (e.g., images or symptoms).

The goal is to:

Build an accurate prediction model for common skin diseases.

Reduce diagnostic time and assist dermatologists.

Provide a foundation for future telemedicine applications.

🔍 Features
Classification of multiple types of skin disorders (e.g., eczema, psoriasis, acne, etc.).

Image preprocessing and augmentation for improved model performance.

Deep learning models such as CNN, MobileNet, or EfficientNet for prediction.

Performance evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

User-friendly interface (optional) for uploading images and getting predictions.

📁 Dataset
Source: [Kaggle] (update with your actual source)

Classes: Example — Eczema, Psoriasis, Melanoma, Acne, etc.

Size: e.g., 1,000+ labeled skin condition images


Note: Ensure ethical use of medical datasets and cite sources appropriately.
